    </ui><br>
    <h2>Direction</h2>
    <h2>Step1</h2>
    <p>Gather all your ingredients.</p>
    <h2>Step 2</h2>
    <p>Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven over medium heat until well browned.</p>
    <h2>Step 3</h2>
    <p>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water. Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil, 1 teaspoon salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer, covered, for about 1 ½ hours, stirring occasionally.</p>
    <h2>Step 4</h2>
    <p>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water.</p>
    <h2>Step 5</h2>
    <p>In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.</p>
    <h2>Step 6<h2>
    <p>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</p>
    <h2>Step 7</h2>
    <p>To assemble, spread 1 ½ cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce, overlapping slightly. Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture.<br>Top with 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 ½ cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.</p>
    <h2>Step 8</h2>
    <p>Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese.<br>Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.</p>
    <h2>Step 9</h2>
    <p>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes.</p>
    <h2>Step 10</h2>
    <p>Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before serving.</p>

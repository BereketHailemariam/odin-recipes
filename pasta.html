    <p>
        While this 30-minute meal is spiked with small shellfish, there's nothing small about the flavors. Garlic, crushed red pepper flakes, tomatoes, and a full cup of basil infuse this Italian seafood pasta with Mediterranean flair. For an extra dose of salty richness, top with a healthy handful of feta cheese.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ui>
        <li>¾ pound Bucatini or other fat spaghetti noodle</li>
        <li>2 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>2 tablespoon cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 pint red and/or yellow cherry tomatoes, halved</li>
        <li>¾ pound wild Patagonia or Gulf shrimp, peeled and deveined</li>
        <li>Generous pinch pinch crushed red pepper</li>
        <li>6 ounce aged feta cheese, broken in pieces</li>
        <li>1 handful basil, thinly sliced (about 1 cup sliced)</li>
        <li>Extra-virgin olive oil (optional)</li>
        <li>Aged feta cheese (optional)</li>
        <h1>Direction</h1>
        <h2>Step 1</h2>
        <p>Bring a large pot of generously salted water to boiling. Add bucatini and cook until al dente, about 9 minutes.<br>Drain, reserving 1/3 cup of the pasta cooking liquid to use for the sauce.</p>
        <h2>Step 2</h2>
        <p>Meanwhile, in a large skillet heat oil over medium-high heat. Add the garlic and tomatoes. Cook, stirring occasionally, until tomatoes soften and the juices begin to bubble, about 3 minutes.<br>
        If the cherry tomatoes give out very little juice, add 1 tablespoon of water and a splash (about ½ teaspoon) of red wine vinegar for acidity.<br>
        Add the shrimp and a large pinch of crushed red pepper then toss just until the shrimp are cooked through, about 2 minutes.
        <h2>Step 3</h2>
        <p>Add the pasta along with reserved pasta cooking liquid.<br>
        Toss together over low heat.Remove from the heat. Stir in the feta and basil; toss with tongs, adding up to 1 Tbsp.<br>
        more oil and additional feta to taste. Divide between four bowls. Serve warm. Makes 4 servings.</p>

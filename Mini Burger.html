    <h1>Directions</h1>
    <h2>Step 1</h2>
    <p>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Gather all ingredients.</p>
    <h2>Step 2</h2>
    <p>Line a large-rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil. Press ground chuck into a thin, even 11- x 9-inch rectangle on prepared baking sheet.<br>Sprinkle evenly with salt, pepper, and garlic powder.</p>
    <h2>Step 3</h2>
    <p>Bake in preheated oven until a thermometer inserted into thickest portion of beef registers 140°F to 145°F, about 10 minutes.<br>Using 2 large spatulas, transfer beef to a cutting board lined with paper towels; discard foil.</p>
    <h2>Step 4</h2>
    <p>Line same baking sheet with a new piece of foil; lightly coat with cooking spray.<br>
        Using a serrated bread knife, cut rolls in half horizontally, keeping top halves and bottom halves intact.<br>Place the bottom half of rolls cut-side up on prepared baking sheet.</p>
    <h2>Step 5</h2>
    <p>Spread Big Mac Sauce evenly over bottom half of rolls.</p>
    <h2>Step 6</h2>
    <p>Place beef patty over sauce, topping evenly with cheese slices, pickles, and onion.</p>
    <h2>Step 7</h2>
    <p>Place top half of rolls over pickles and onions. Brush tops and sides of rolls with melted butter, and sprinkle evenly with sesame seeds.</p>
    <h2>Step 8</h2>
    <p>Bake in preheated oven until top buns are golden brown and cheese is melted, about 10 minutes.</p>
    <h2>Step 9</h2>
    <p>Carefully remove bun tops, sprinkle lettuce in an even layer, and replace bun tops.</p>
    <h2>Step 10</h2>
    <p>Cut sliders into 12 portions; serve with additional Big Mac Sauce.</p>
